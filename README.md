## Tech Stack

The project back-end is created using Fast API in Python and React is used for the front-end. Tailwind CSS classes are used to style the UI components. It uses "react-form-hooks" for validating forms and Redux for state management. For the database "Postgres" has been used.

## Introduction

It is a simple Kanban board application where you have four status 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'In Review' and 'Done'. You can create a generic task item and then through Kanban drag and drop dashboard, you can move items and save the updated status.

It has supoort for multi-user authentication.

It now supports project CRUD operations. A task can be a part of a project. A slide-show component using the library react-awesome-slider was also added recently.
